Hello World!

My name is Divya Sri Praturi and I am currently employed as a postdoc in the Climate Physics department of Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPIM). My research in MPIM is mainly focused on understanding the dynamics of ITCZ and Hadley circulation. To this end, I make use of data from global km-scale coupled atmosphere-ocean-land simulations. My research framework is as follows: I mainly start with the equations to develop some zeroth order hypotheses, which then get refined upon analysing the simulation data.

Before working on atmospheric flows:

- I have worked on understanding:
  - the mechanisms of stabilization in action at various regimes of plasma shear flows;
  - how the nonlinear transfer of energy to smaller scales happens in a solenoidal mode vs. a dilational mode in compressible turbulence. 

- Applying Lie group theory to derive scaling laws for compressible turbulence:
  - this required deriving a unified framework of hierarchy of equations to describe turbulence in compressible flows. 

Please keep watching this space as I slowly update this page to include current and future work of mine.
